# Doubly-Debiased-Lasso-in-Partially-Linear-Model-Under-Hidden-Confounding

This is my undergraduate dissertation. By combining Partial Linear Model and Doubly Debiased Lasso proposed by ZIJIAN GUO et al. its application is extended to nonlinear models. The new model has a linear part and a nonlinear part, and can simultaneously remove the bias caused by Lasso and Hidden Confounding in the high-dimensional case.

这是我的本科毕业设计。通过结合ZIJIAN GUO等人提出的Doubly Debiased Lasso和部分线性模型使其应用推广到非线性模型。新模型有线性部分和非线性部分，且可以同时去除高维情况下Lasso和Hidden Confounding带来的偏差。
